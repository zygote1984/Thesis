\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis we explore new modularization paradigms and component integration technologies for handling the introduction of new features into legacy systems.
This introductory chapter sets the context for this thesis and presents an overview of our research domain.

\section{The Context}
In component-based design, a \emph{component} is defined as self-contained structure with a clear function which communicates through a pre-determined interface. 
Component-based design is yet another way to decompose software into maintainable and reusable parts.
In a smaller scale, this is anologous to the class concept in the object-oriented design paradigm. 
In fact a component can even be a single class.

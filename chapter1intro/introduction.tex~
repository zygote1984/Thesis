\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis we explore new modularization paradigms and component integration technologies for handling the introduction of new features into legacy systems.
This introductory chapter sets the context for this thesis and presents an overview of our research domain.

\begin{itemize}
 \item In component-based design, a \emph{component} is defined as self-contained structure with a clear function which communicates through a pre-determined interface. 
 \item In a smaller scale, this is anologous to the class concept in the object-oriented design paradigm. 
  \item In fact a component can even be a single class.
\item Such modules are used to decompose software into maintainable and reusable parts.
\item In order to obtain a fucntional software, modules which contain various features of a software should be integrated.
\item The software architecture defines how these modules are connected to each other.
\item However the requriements of software change after its deployement.
\end{itemize}

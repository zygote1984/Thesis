& Oce Chapter.
    && Recycle material from the book chapter.
    && Clearly introduce the discovered problem and decompose it into two separate parts.
    	&&& First part concerns instance pointcuts.
    	&&& Second part integration problem.
    	&&& Whole problem is solved with the integration of these two solutions.
& Ipc Chapter.
	&& Revise the paper, possibly extend it, to integrate as a chapter.
	&& Some changes may come from the ECOOP Submission.
	&& Usage with design patterns should be more elaborate in the thesis, this can go to the validation section.
& Integration Framework Chapter.
	&& Still the idea has to be worked out completely.
& Usage-based adaptation Chapter.
	&& Possibly the framework should be extended to host instance pointcuts.
